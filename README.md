1. Upsampling
The number of pixels in the down-sampled image can be increased by using up-sampling interpolation techniques. The up-sampling technique increases the resolution as well as the size of the image. There are 3 common technique which is Nearest neighbor, interpolation Bilinear, and interpolation Cubic interpolation. Based on my analysis, The best technique to upsample an image is by using bicubic technique.

2. Downsampling
In the down-sampling technique, the number of pixels in the given image is reduced depending on the sampling frequency. Due to this, the resolution and size of the image decrease. There are also 3 common technique to down sample image which is average, max, and median. Based on my analysis, the best technique to downsample an image is by using max technique.
