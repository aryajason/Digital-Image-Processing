1. Upsampling
The number of pixels in the down-sampled image can be increased by using up-sampling interpolation techniques. The up-sampling technique increases the resolution as well as the size of the image. There are 3 common technique which is Nearest neighbor, interpolation Bilinear, and interpolation Cubic interpolation.

2. Downsampling
In the down-sampling technique, the number of pixels in the given image is reduced depending on the sampling frequency. Due to this, the resolution and size of the image decrease.
